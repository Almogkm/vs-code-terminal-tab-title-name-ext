Yes, make me the extension so that when I run scripts it will take the filename being run and name the tab accordingly. 
In cursor this works for any code that I run... python, R, bash / sh, etc.
Take as long as you need, make sure you know how to make such a thing and learn any required skills before you work. 
I need this to work on the first time and not break my IDE... 

I have a better idea. Make the most accurate instructions file for an agent to handle this task. 
Include all the background, examples, discoveries and conclusions we had in this current conversation. 
It is important, as I wrote here, that the agent first does a comprehensive learning session about the subject. 

How did Cursor do it? 
he should try to learn as much as he can from `https://cursor.com/docs/` and `https://cursor.com/docs/api/` and from the cloned git repos - the one that was initially uploaded and the one right before all the files were taken down. I created a directory that holds each version of the repo ('/First upload' and '/Last available open source version'). 
He can also learn how to build extensions to vs code here `https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension`, and here 'https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/extension-anatomy', and there is A LOT more information in the various topics under this url `https://code.visualstudio.com/api` that if he cannot access, he can ask and I will try to get it for him.
There should be optimal and clear steps in the instructions so that it is possible to do everything without running out of tokens (context limit: ~192k–272k tokens per thread).
So maybe make more steps, with the result of each step as md file of what was learned etc. Or if it was a coding step than the result is obviously the scripts. There should be a "self-checking" step every couple of coding steps to see that everything still makes sense, go over what was learned (read the md files of the learning steps), read all the scripts to gain an understanding of the entire updated codebase, output md of TODOs if there are fixes needed. Also during this "self-checking" step, the agent needs to see if there were any new skills learnt and update SKILLS.md accordingly.
Create any other important file as md that will define, refine and control the agent abilities and behaviour. 
I believe that I will need to run a prompt for each step, so make sure to generate the proper prompt for each step right now, in advance. 
There is no limit on the amount of steps.
I've also added some files from OpenAI and Hugging Face that talk about agent creation that you can first read and learn from them before you design my agent. 
Output as TERMINAL_RENAME_EXT_INSTRUCTIONS_GRAND_SCHEME.md (and any other needed md file for the agent).
