Coding task: create the VS Code extension skeleton (no-build JS).

Goals:
- Create extension/ folder with a JavaScript entrypoint (CommonJS).
- Minimal activation; logging; command palette entry “Terminal Tab Titles: Debug Info”.
- No terminal renaming yet.

Deliverables:
- extension/package.json
- extension/extension.js
- extension/.vscode/launch.json
- CHECKPOINTS/060_extension_skeleton.md

Safety:
- No network.
- No modifying user settings automatically.
