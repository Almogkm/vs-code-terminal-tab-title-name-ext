Learning task: Study VS Code terminal tab titles and formatting variables.

Goals:
- Determine which variables exist for terminal tab titles/description.
- Verify what ${sequence} is and how it behaves.
- Document how terminal shell integration affects command detection and terminal metadata.
- Note limitations: lack of conditional templating, lack of basename transforms, etc.

Deliverables:
- docs/learning_vscode_terminal_titles.md: concise but complete, with links and key quotes (short snippets only).
- CHECKPOINTS/010_vscode_terminal_titles.md: summary and implications for our design.
- Update SKILLS.md if new skills were learned.

Constraints:
- Do not start coding yet.
- Be explicit about what's verified vs uncertain.
