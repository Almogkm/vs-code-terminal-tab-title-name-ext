# EVALS.md

(Placeholder — will be populated after MVP.)

## Evaluation goals
- Title persists after command ends.
- Works with “Run Python File in Dedicated Terminal”.
- Supports python/R/bash/sh at minimum.

## Minimal manual checks
- Run `python calculate_TVA_single.py` → title becomes `Python: calculate_TVA_single.py` and stays.
- Run `bash run.sh` → title becomes `bash: run.sh` and stays.
