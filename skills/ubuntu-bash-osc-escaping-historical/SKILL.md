# Ubuntu/Bash OSC Escaping Patterns (Historical)

## Purpose
This skill preserves Ubuntu/bash-first OSC emission and escaping learnings as historical context. It helps explain prior Linux-specific design work without reviving deprecated runtime behavior.

## When to Use
- When reviewing Linux-first historical notes.
- When clarifying old OSC/bash escape decisions.
- When auditing docs for current-vs-historical clarity.

## Inputs
- Ubuntu/bash-focused historical OSC notes.
- Linux-specific escaping constraints from prior docs.

## Outputs
- Historical Linux context retained and clearly labeled.
- Reduced confusion about active runtime mechanism.

## Procedure
1. Keep Ubuntu/bash OSC notes in place.
2. Mark them historical where current implementation differs.
3. Cross-reference current rename-command approach when needed.

## Constraints
- Must:
  - Preserve Ubuntu/bash OSC learnings as historical reference.
  - Keep Linux-specific escaping concerns documented.
- Must Not:
  - Present OSC/bash emission as current runtime requirement.
- Avoid:
  - Deleting historical Linux context that explains earlier decisions.

## Examples
- Example 1:
  - Context: A Linux note documents BEL/ST terminators.
  - Steps:
    - Keep original content.
    - Add historical marker.
  - Expected result:
    - Linux-specific knowledge remains available as context.

## Verification
- Confirm Ubuntu/bash OSC notes are still present and labeled historical where applicable.
