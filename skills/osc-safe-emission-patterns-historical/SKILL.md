# Safe OSC Emission Patterns (Historical)

## Purpose
This skill preserves historical learning about safer OSC emission patterns across bash/zsh, PowerShell, and Windows console constraints. It remains documentation context only.

## When to Use
- When interpreting older OSC-related notes.
- When documenting why emission safety patterns were considered.
- When marking obsolete runtime paths as historical.

## Inputs
- Historical OSC emission notes.
- Cross-shell constraints mentioned in prior learning docs.

## Outputs
- Accurate historical context with cross-platform emission caveats.
- Clear separation from current rename-command runtime.

## Procedure
1. Locate historical OSC emission guidance.
2. Retain it as historical context.
3. Prevent accidental reactivation in current runtime guidance.

## Constraints
- Must:
  - Keep OSC emission patterns as historical reference only.
  - Preserve cross-platform caveats noted in prior learning.
- Must Not:
  - Reintroduce OSC emission as active rename path by default.
- Avoid:
  - Mixing historical emission recommendations with current implementation instructions.

## Examples
- Example 1:
  - Context: A note references safe quoting for OSC emission.
  - Steps:
    - Keep the note.
    - Label as historical.
  - Expected result:
    - Prior safety rationale remains accessible.

## Verification
- Confirm OSC emission guidance is labeled historical in maintained docs.
