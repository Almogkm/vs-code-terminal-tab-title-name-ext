# OSC Title Sequences and xterm.js Behavior (Historical)

## Purpose
This skill preserves historical learning about OSC 0/2 sequences and xterm.js title-change behavior. It is retained for context and archaeology, not as current runtime implementation.

## When to Use
- When reviewing prior experiments around terminal title sequences.
- When explaining why OSC-based approaches were superseded.
- When annotating historical docs/checkpoints.

## Inputs
- Historical learning notes on OSC 0/2.
- Checkpoints that discuss xterm.js sequence behavior.

## Outputs
- Correct historical framing of OSC-based experiments.
- Clear separation from active rename-command design.

## Procedure
1. Locate OSC-related statements in docs/checkpoints.
2. Label them as historical in-place when needed.
3. Keep references accessible without reviving OSC emission logic.

## Constraints
- Must:
  - Preserve OSC/xterm.js notes as historical reference.
  - Keep historical context accessible.
- Must Not:
  - Treat OSC sequences as active runtime behavior in current extension design.
- Avoid:
  - Removing historical evidence that explains prior decisions.

## Examples
- Example 1:
  - Context: A design note says OSC 2 sets title.
  - Steps:
    - Keep the note.
    - Add historical annotation indicating superseded approach.
  - Expected result:
    - Historical trace remains intact and unambiguous.

## Verification
- Confirm OSC mentions in docs are clearly marked historical where applicable.
