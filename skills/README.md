# Skills Directory

This repository stores agent skills in `./skills/` as one folder per skill, with `SKILL.md` inside each folder.

At session start, scan `./skills/*/SKILL.md` and register them.

`./SKILLS.md` is the top-level index/overview only; canonical per-skill details live in files under `./skills/`.
